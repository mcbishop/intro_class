# Given a dictionary of items and their prices, write a program that returns the most expensive 
#item.

prices = {"banana":4,"apple":5,"orange":1.5,"pear":3}

# look at each price of each item
# compare banana price to apple, orange, pear
# if it's bigger than everything, print key and price
# else, go to the next item and compare it to the rest of the list

for fruit in prices:
	if banana[value]<apple[value]:
		go to next item, repeat



# biggest price wins so we want answer to be apple
